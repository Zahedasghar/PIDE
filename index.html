## The Assumed Shortage of Housing

"We are short of 10 million housing units" has been the clarion cry in
politics, media and the donor-driven research for the last 10 years.
Given an average household size of well over six persons^[Average household size comes to 6.56 persons using the PSLM 2019-20.], this means
that nearly one-third of the population is without housing. Do we see
such a huge number of people living on footpaths, side of roads, under
bridges or in any open area? **Thankfully, NO!** 

 We cannot find any clarity on where this huge figure of 10 million housing shortage came
from! 

- Media (print, electronic and social) uses it referring to it as
a World Bank estimate, while various World Bank^[Enclude, “Final Report: Diagnostic Survey of Housing Finance in Pakistan”. Submitted to the State Bank of Pakistan. November 2015.], ^[International Growth Centre (IGC). “Housing inequality in Pakistan: The case of affordable housing.” February 2016] publications quote a report submitted to the State Bank as the source, along with a study
done by the International Growth Centre (IGC)^[International Growth Centre (IGC). “Housing inequality in Pakistan: The case of affordable housing.” February 2016] (a DFID funded global
research effort out of the LSE and Oxford). 

- The IGC report cites a
SBP^[State Bank of Pakistan, “Quarterly Housing Finance Review”, March 2014] report, but interestingly, the said report gives a lower per
annum figure than the one quoted by the IGC. 
- A more recent State Bank
document^[
State Bank of Pakistan, “Infrastructure, Housing and SME Finance Department”, March 2019.] cites no source and just uses the number as a given. 
- Some WB
documents refer to a House Building Finance Company Limited's
presentation^[House Building Finance Company Limited. “Affordable Housing for Low Income Group.” Presentation. November 11, 2016.] as the source but nowhere does one find the exact method
used to reach the oft-repeated number. 
The worst part is that the
government also uses this estimate without ever questioning its
validity. And sadly, we have based policy on this assumption and
initiated a large public housing effort at a considerable cost. 
A few indicators to judge the housing conditions include congestion or
crowding, security of tenure, provision of civic amenities, structural
quality and cultural adequacy.^[UN Habitat, Metadata on SDGs Indicator 11.1.1, March 2018. ] The Pakistan Social and Living
Measurement (PSLM) survey, conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of
Statistics (PBS), provides us with the opportunity to look into most of
these factors, and we do so using its 2019-2020 round. Since urban and
rural Pakistan exhibit quite different trends we look at them
separately, along with some provincial patterns.

### IS CONGESTION THE SOURCE OF "HOUSING SHORTAGE"?

Using the definition given by the UN-Habitat.^[Op cit.] , *"a house is
considered to have a sufficient living area for the household members if
not more than 3 people share the habitable room that is a minimum of 4m2
in area"*. The 4m2 was rightly upgraded to 9m2 , as the measurement was
too small. We do not get room sizes in the PSLM, but the number of
living rooms is covered in the survey. Since 9 sq^2 is a typical size
even in informal settlements so we would go by the number of persons per
room to estimate congestion. 

Our estimates suggest that 4.37 million households, equaling 12.3% of
the total households, live in congested conditions, with over two-thirds
of these in rural areas (3.04 million), as shown in Table 1. Young
children generally live/sleep in their parents' room so we do not
include children aged under 5 years, and half-count those under 12
years, while estimating occupancy per room. So, if congestion is the
rationale behind the 10 million housing deficit, our estimates give a
much lower number.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE, results='asis'}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)
housing <- read_excel("housing.xlsx")
View(housing)
housing<-as.data.frame(housing)
knitr::kable(housing, caption = "Number and Proportion of Households Living in Congested Conditions",col.names = c('', 'Total number of households (million)', 'Household with occupancy of over 3 persons per room (million)', 'Proportion living in crowded conditions (%)'))
```
Some inter-provincial differences are also found (see Table 2).


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
housing1 <-  read_excel("housing.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet2")
housing1<- as.data.frame(housing1)
knitr::kable(housing1, caption = "Table 2 : Proportion of Households Living in Crowded Conditions (%)",col.names = c(' ', 'Rural', 'Urban', 'Total', 'Number of HH living in crowded conditions (millions)'))

```

Unlike many countries, joint/extended families are still prevalent in Pakistan, with strong cultural values attached to it.
The rates, however, are not as high as one would think as 74% of the households have nuclear set-ups, with not very divergent
trends exhibited by rural and urban Pakistan (see Table 3).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
housing11 <-  read_excel("housing.xlsx", sheet = "table3")
housing11<- as.data.frame(housing11)
knitr::kable(housing11, caption = "Table 3: Family Structure in Pakistan (%)
",col.names = c(' ', 'Nuclear', 'Extended/Joint', 'Total'))

```
Is the extended/joint family structure the reason behind this congestion? Table 4 shows that joint/extended households
do have a larger size (i.e. average household members) and a slightly higher rate for congestion, but the living arrangement is
not exactly a huge factor in determining congestion. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
housing111 <-  read_excel("housing.xlsx", sheet = "table4")
housing111<- as.data.frame(housing111)
knitr::kable(housing111, caption = "Table 4: Living Arrangement, Mean Household Size and Prevalence of Congestion")


```

### IS THE OCCUPANCY STATUS LEADING TO THE NOTION OF ‘DEFICIT’? 

Security of tenure, gauged by the occupancy status in the PSLM, shows that this cannot be the case either as Pakistanis
predominantly live in owned houses. As Table 5 shows, only a small proportion (11%) lives in rented houses. The sensational
deficit estimate makes no mention of the fact that the ownership of dwellings is as much as 82% in Pakistan and rented space is
only 11%. In any case, living in rented houses does not represent a ‘deficit’.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
housing1111 <-  read_excel("housing.xlsx", sheet = "table5")
housing1111<- as.data.frame(housing1111)
knitr::kable(housing1111, caption = "Table 5: Occupancy Status
",col.names = c(' ', 'Rural', 'Urban', 'Pakistan'))

```
> Contrary to common
perception, living in a
rented house does not
show ‘housing deficit’.

## ARE THE HOUSES STRUCTURALLY STABLE AND HAVE ACCESS TO AMENITIES? 

This is where the concern should be. The quality of structure and access to civic amenities need to improve. Table 6
shows that access to basic civic services, like waste disposal, clean drinking water, safe fuel for cooking and a much-improved
sewerage system are the issues that need attention to alleviate the quality of housing. Even the very high access to electricity
(for light source) does not mean an uninterrupted supply. 


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
housing6 <-  read_excel("housing.xlsx", sheet = "table6")
table6<- as.data.frame(housing6)
knitr::kable(table6, caption = "Table 6: Quality of Structure and Access to Amenities (%)
",col.names = c(' ', 'Floor',	'Roof',	'Walls',	'Fuel for cooking',	'Source of light',	'Waste disposal',	'Drinking water',	'Toilet'
))

```



## SO, WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT? 
There is certainly not a “deficit of 10 million housing units” in Pakistan. There may be “inadequate housing” in the
country, but not a “housing shortage”. The deficit is in the quality of life in the houses, not the absence of housing units.
Even if we take into account the high fertility rate and rising population in the country, an additional demand of 0.7
million households every year, as suggested by the IGC study (2016)^[Op cit.], is very high. Going by the mean household size, it
means an additional 4.5 million people needing accommodation- an estimate that appears far from reality. The mean age of the head of the household in Pakistan is 44 years^[Estimated from the PSLM 2019-2020.], and given the cultural milieu, young adults do not generally live on their own,
thus, suppressing the demand for additional housing that could have been there because of the youth bulge.

## CONCLUSIONS

The notion of housing shortage, and the belief that it creates employment, have led the government to push for and
subsidise the construction sector. Along with fiscal pressure, it has created an unnatural demand in the real estate market. And
while the ‘shortage’ is more in the rural areas, all the housing initiatives are taking place in the urban areas. A forthcoming
PIDE study on sectoral productivity over the last decade also shows the construction industry to be among the least productive
ones. Any protected/subsidised industry remains unproductive, and the construction industry proves to be no exception.
Migration from rural areas is given as another reason for increased housing demand in urban areas. It is a movement that
we at PIDE support. Instead of considering it a problem, we believe that it is through cities that growth happens^[ Haque and Nayab, “Cities: Engine of Growth”, PIDE, Islamabad, 2007]. Better urban
planning, supporting large-scale, mixed-use housing, can go a long way in providing quality affordable accommodation to
people. Doing so would deal with whatever housing shortage is there, and more importantly, tackle the quality issue as well.
PIDE has also shown that housing shortage arises from the harsh zoning laws and building regulations that favour cars
and single-family homes^[“The PIDE Reform Agenda for Accelerated and Sustained Growth”, PIDE, Islamabad, 2020.]. In addition, PIDE has shown that the shortage of opportunities and high rates of sub-optimal
employment^[Haque and Nayab, “Opportunities to Excel: Now and the Future”, PIDE, Islamabad, 2020.] reduce the purchasing power of people.
PIDE thesis is that the shortage is that of opportunities not housing. However, sensational figures and perhaps the push
for loans has led to a distortion in policy of putting housing before opportunity. Furthermore, opportunity too has been
constrained by the same factor as housing which is excessive regulations (see PIDE Sludge Series15^[
PIDE Sludge Series- various issues estimating the cost of bureaucracy, PIDE, Islamabad, 2020, 2021.]). Clearly, deregulation
which is the need of the time has been delayed because policy is driven more by sensational figures than good analysis.
Finally, government should take seriously the PIDE recommendation that local universities and think tanks must be
involved in policy, policy research and policymaking. Nothing without being thoroughly reviewed should be taken to the
policy table. Our experience tells us that reliance on consultants without domestic oversight has too often proved costly. And
the 10 million housing shortage estimate is nothing but yet another proof of this cost!
